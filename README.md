# Haro eberinyaan~

Introducing my name **Yefta Yosia Asyel**
<!--
**yeftakun/yeftakun** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying at Universitas Sam Ratulangi
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript dasar at [Dicoding](https://www.dicoding.com/users/yeftakun/academies).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Anime and Game
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: wibu
- âš¡ Fun fact: Replacing your github profile picture with a picture of an anime girl doesn't make you good at coding.
If you are interested in getting to know me, please follow my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yefta-yosia-asyel-43b802288) account.
